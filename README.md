# Super-resolution Landmark Detection Networks for Medical Images
Here is the official implementation of the paper.

## Requirments
We trained our models depending on:
Pytorch 1.13.1
Python 3.8
mmcv>=2.0.0rc1,<2.1.0
mmengine>=0.4.0,<1.0.0

## Train and infer
The configs is located in /configs/3dnii/.
The training and infering methods are according to [openmmlabe](https://mmsegmentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
